## Summary
>[!example] What happened?
>After arriving in Bongrain, we decided it would be best to gather information. That decision led us to the temple of Arawn, god of life and death. There, we met an older human named Lorac and a young halfling named Garrett. Through them, we learned of strange rituals happening in the forest that caused misfortune to those that happened to see them.
>
>We were told to look for a hunter named Ander, as he'd have more information. After locating him, he agreed to lead us to the spot in the forest where he saw this strange ritual taking place. In the forest, we fought a large number of goblins. Before we got overwhelmed, a group of elves arrived to help us out. They revealed themselves to be Leah's family, and they took us to their home in the treetops.

## Notes
### The Town in the Forest
We began by immediately getting derailed. We set off by trying to see if wolfsbane could be located around us, and we spent some time trying to identify the appearance of it as well as its properties.

Leah and Volvenheimn noticed with their passive insight that the two of them were getting quizzical looks. After a quick conversation with a little boy, the gang put our heads together to try and locate a temple. Arawn (god of life and death)—not to be confused with Hela, the goddess of the dead—Rao (god of peace and reason), and Incabulos (god of plague and famine) seemed to be the likely candidates for temples in this area. People don't tend to pray to Incabulos to incite plagues, but rather to stave them off. With this newfound knowledge, we decided that it would be a good idea to look for a temple of some sort.

I looked around and spotted what appeared to be the very tip top edge of a steeple peering out above the trees. When we arrived, it appeared to be a quaint little temple themed around nature and its bounties. The holy symbol was a black star stylized against a black background—the symbol of Arawn. On the inside were just a few people, going about their business.

### Arawn's Temple
I stepped forward to put 5 gold pieces in the offering tray. When I did this, it got the attention of the fellow that was reading a large tome in the corner. He was a human, rather old. He didn't mention much about the monuments, but he did say that there was a dwarven stronghold nearby. Daring hunters live in Bongrain, though, and they often paid tribute to Arawn by sacrificing animals in His name. The big centerpiece on the altar, which was adorned with blood and trophies from slain animals, was an enormous, ornate set of antlers. The hunters often spoke of strange elven practices in the forest.

When Volvenheimn entered the temple, he spent a few minutes taking off his armor to sit down at a pew and pray. A young-looking halfling named **Garrett Hilltopple**, who was watering the plants around the interior, approached him and the others. He had a pendant of Arawn's holy symbol, but was otherwise dressed in basic farmer's clothes, just without shoes. He had a charming remark for everyone except Leah ("At least you look nice!").

Upon asking about the monuments, Garrett spoke of a grove. **Ander** killed the largest stag he'd ever seen and brought the skull onto the altar. Garrett told us that Ander would be able to tell us more information.

Leah overheard my conversation and walked over to talk to the older human about the elven rituals in the forest. There was a clearing where elves got together to practice some type of religious ceremony around an enormous tree. Leah was not able to ascertain the specifics of this ritual. He was able to tell her about the forest, which seems peaceful, but it can be dangerous. The ritual site apparently isn't just one place—it doesn't *stay* in one place. How the elves locate this site is beyond the knowledge of himself and Ander. It sounded like fey involvement to Leah, though. This place does pose some sort of risk to the local populace, and the people we met at the temple would be willing to assist if we were to try and figure out what's going on with it.

The people that stumble upon these practices are victim to misfortune—some hunters come back with injuries, and some don't come back at all. It affects the people in the greatest need the most, since they have to get their own food from the forest. When aspiring hunters see a big tree, they know things are going to get bad.

Returning to Garrett, I had a brief conversation where he said that there were blue, green, and gold dragonborn around here previously. The green guy went away, the gold one is a bit of a merchant, and the blue one was actually a culinarian-type fellow. He went far up north in the desert somewhere. The nice chap even invited us to his house for dinner!

### Searching for Ander
Leah came around back and told us about the conversation she had with the old human. We decided it best to seek out Ander next, so we went back to the old human—his name was **Lorac**—and tried to see if he could point us in Ander's direction. He told us that Ander could be at the fletcher shop, tavern, bazaar, or his house, which he told us the location of. Ander was a human with medium brown hair, a medium length beard, and brown eyes.

We checked out his house first, with no response. Celeste left Poe behind to keep lookout in case Ander returned, and we set off to the tavern to see if maybe he was there. Luckily, we spotted him at the tavern and he was able to tell us about his experience with the rituals. Two or three years ago, he stepped into a grove. He took a step towards it and a set of stairs magically appeared beneath his feet, leading down to a large tree. Some of the elves present were dancing, praying, doing all types of religious actions around the tree.

It didn't feel right for Ander to get closer, like he didn't belong in that place. The elves didn't seem to notice his presence; it was almost like the forest itself didn't want him to be there. On the way back to town, he saw the giant stag that he killed for its skull. He interpreted it as the forest thanking him for not interfering with the ceremony taking place. He agreed to lead us to the edge of the forest where this happened. I told him that we had obligations (dinner with Garrett) and that we'd meet him at the temple in the morning.

### Dinner at Garrett's
We set off to Garrett's house for dinner, which turned out to be a hole in the hill. He introduced us to his family:

- Trim, youngest daughter
- Lavenia, wife
- Portia, daughter
- Merla, oldest daughter
- Finnan, son
- Eric, son
- Roscoe, son

The chairs were halfling sized, but we were able to double up to make them more suitable for normal people. They brought out bread and fondue, followed by chicken and dumplings. The entrée was a big ham served with sweet gravy. To finish it off, Lavenia brought out an apple and blackberry pie. We recounted some of our tales, including the harrowing story about Celeste's death. They were entirely captivated by the stories.

We helped out around after dinner. We moved furniture around to make room for us to put bedrolls down, and we helped out with chores. I did such a good job cleaning all the dishes with prestidigitation.

### Into the Unknown
Morning came, and it was time to head to the temple. We left our horses in Garrett's care there at the temple, and Ander led us to the woods like he said he would. After we reached the spot where he thought the incident occurred. We thanked him, and he went on his way.

We spotted a circle of mushrooms, about 20 feet in diameter. There was a set of deer tracks going into the circle, but there were none leaving. We were immediately suspicious about it, and tried sending both a mage hand and Poe to check it out with no success. Defeated, we instead decided to look around the forest to see if there was anything else unusual around.

We arrived at a rocky outcrop. On top of a large boulder was a goblin wearing what looked like a jester's outfit. He taunted us while voices behind him whispered at him to get down from the rock. I tried intimidating him by cooking up an eldritch blast in my hand, and though it was highly intimidating, they didn't seem to be intelligent enough to catch on. They *were* intelligent enough to turn me into a pincushion, though. We looked to be outnumbered when arrows flew in from seemingly nowhere, killing off the goblins. We were saved by a group of wood elves.

### Elves from Above
An elf, possibly the leader, introduced himself to us. His name was **Aramil**, and he introduced the other elves in the trees to us as his kin. As it turns out, these were Leah's people! What a small world. Leah gave a brief explanation that we knew where we were going, but we didn't know where we were going. She told them about the grove and how we didn't know exactly where it was. It sounded like it could have been either the solstice or equinox rituals, Aramil said. It sounds like the elders could know more.

The forest seems to be getting angry. It's unclear what's causing it, be it the goblins or other possible interlopers. Aramil and the other elves tapped on the trees with their bows, and handlebars for everyone—including us!—descended from above. The handles wrapped around our wrists and we were hoisted up into the canopy. It was a sight to behold; the sunbeams streamed down upon an entire settlement that was made out of the treetops. It was interesting seeing this since it was so impossible to see it from the ground. Falling down from this height would likely be fatal.

Neither of Leah's parents were in town, unfortunately. Luckily, most of the important bits of conversation were in common, so we understood everything that was going on. With all of us briefed and now in the elven treetop settlement, we decided to take a little while to think about what our next move might be.

## Recap (Last Session)
>[!example] What happened?
>Our journey through the forest continued. Right away, we stumbled upon four mercenaries trying to surround and kill a unicorn, a creature known for its divinity and for being a symbol of good. After dispatching the mercenaries, we learned the creature's name: Stellan. He spoke telepathically in an odd language, and he sternly and quickly told the fey creature to give Leah her name back.
>
>We finally made it to Bongrain, a city known for its culinarians. We restocked on basic supplies and then stopped to think about what to do next.
