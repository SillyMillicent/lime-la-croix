title: Dear Willow,
unlisted: true

I write to you not as a professor, but as a friend. The events that have transpired in recent days have shaken me to my core, leading me to a revelation that I feel compelled to share with you.

For years, I have dedicated myself to the study of arcane magic, delving into the intricacies of the Weave and the mysteries it holds. Yet, in my pursuit of knowledge and power, I have overlooked a fundamental truth that has been staring me in the face all along.

Nature, with its boundless beauty and unfathomable complexity, possesses a magic of its own; it possesses a magic that is as potent and profound as any spell woven by mortal hands. It is a magic that flows through every living thing, uniting us all in ways that I am only beginning to comprehend.

This realization has come to me not through years of study or experimentation, but in a single moment of clarity. Whether it was a stroke of insight granted by the gods or mere fate, I cannot say. What I do know is that it has forever changed the way I view the world around me.

I write this letter not to preach to you, but to maybe give you something to think about. As a fellow seeker of knowledge, I implore you to consider the implications of what I have said. There is a power within you, Willow, a power that transcends the confines of traditional magic. It is a power that comes from the very heart of nature itself. All you have to do is find out how to harness its potency.

I do not know what the future holds or what fate awaits me beyond this mortal coil. All I ask is that you remember these words and carry them with you on your journey. The world is vast and full of wonders, and it is up to each of us to uncover its secrets and embrace its magic in all its forms.

I feel like I am on the verge of discovering something big now that this world has truly been opened up to me. When the time comes, I must ask for your assistance. I am going to need help with what I have planned. I will discuss the fine details with you the next time I am able to have a conversation with you in private, as this is a very important matter.

Farewell, Willow. I hope to hear from you soon. May the earth beneath your feet remain ever stable.

With deepest respect,
Professor Lucien Blackstrand
