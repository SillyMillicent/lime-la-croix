lately, i've been learning more about the IT industry, and i feel like it would be helpful for me to have a simple web page as a project, of sorts. i'll add more to it when i have more to say.

~~right now, it seems like the site is only viewable on desktop. whoops. i'll get that sorted out at some point, probably.~~ the website's navigation works on mobile/high DPI displays now, but i cannot for the life of me figure out how to disable the fullscreen fade out gradient thing. i've taken one step forward and two steps back. what a wonderful welcome to the world of technology.
