## Summary
>[!summary] What happened?
>We tamed the spirit of the forest, but it was too late. To our shock, the relic had actually been stolen some time before we managed to get to it. The thief was an elf with long, dirty blonde hair. We decided that we needed to be proactive and get the relics before the thief since we'd likely cross paths with him this way.

>Our next destination is clear: we need to go to Morith Qvenshal.

## Notes
### The Relic Thief
The spirit emerged once more after placing my quarterstaff in the notches. He asked, "Are you here to make an offering?" He apologized and said that an elven wizard, dressed in simple clothing, had already taken the relic. It was stolen. Interestingly, the magic seemed to not belong to him. The thief seemed distraught when first arriving in the feywild, acting lostâ€”as if he didn't know what he was doing or why he was there. His demeanor changed into an aggressive one, and that's when the staff was stolen. This all happened within the past 2 weeks, although there was no way of telling if the 2 weeks here were the same as 2 weeks back in the material plane. The elf has long, dirty blonde hair and kept a small book (with nothing on the front cover) close to his person. It was made of leather and had a clasp on the front. The spirit did not think that this could be a wizard's tome.

#### Theorizing
I think that it's impossible to try and find the thief with how little information we have. I think that the best course of action would be to try and find the remaining relics before the thief finds any more. If he's after what we're after, we're going to run into him eventually. It's better for us to have more relics than him. We could try having an ear to the ground and listen for any news about an elf with a newfound power relating to nature.

If we were to expedite our search for the relics, the next best place to go to would be Morith Qvenshal. I speculated that there was a potential selection of mounts that would be fit for desert travel:

- camels
- mules
- giant lizards (desert lizards, not our swamp lizards)
- giant hyenas
- somehow being able to hitch a ride on a friendly dragon

None of these seemed to be at the stables, from what I could recall. I suggested that we go back to Bongrain to see if anyone knows how to get to the sand sleds and the fastest way to get there.

### Another Journey
Once we got back, we'd learned that we'd been in the alternate plane for *4 days.* It was a shock to me since it felt like we'd only spent about half an hour in there with the nature spirit. This put into question how much time had really passed since the relic was stolen. If time had passed the same for the thief, it means that he potentially stole the relic *years* ago. There was no way to tell how long it had been; all I knew is that it was crucial that we get to the next relic immediately.

After some asking around, we learned from a local (he seemed like the traveler type) that there was a small village called Dustkeep about 6 days of walking to the northwest. It apparently has a watering hole. People call it the "gateway to the desert." We briefly toyed with the idea of sailing along the coast instead of going through the desert, but the local said that we'd spend more time on the boat than in the desert, and with the choppy waters, there was a risk of us getting knocked off course towards Speartip Crag instead. We decided that being attacked by anything in the infested waters or getting stranded on the rocky outcrop was not worth the hassle.

We restocked on some basic supplies, and after telling the public of Bongrain that the spirit of the forest wasn't malicious, it was full steam ahead to Dustkeep.
