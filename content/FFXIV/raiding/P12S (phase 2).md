# general notes
- [the pastebin that everyone in aether talks about](https://pastebin.com/gc93tBFY)
- warrior can invuln both tentacle slam tank busters. i’m not sure about other tanks, but paladin can only do one or the other.
- practically every raidwide needs some hearty mitigation. even with BIS, i still die to the UAV 1 raidewide as WHM if there’s no mit.
- MT can press rampart for the many auto attacks during UAV 1. it will be back up for the many auto attacks during caloric 1.
- MT also takes lots of damage during pangenesis. make sure to keep them alive!
- you are free to move and pre-position in classical 2 the moment the purple tethers attach to you. take advantage of this.
- if you have to use healer LB3 to save the pull during UAV 2, make sure to confirm whether or not someone ran off the edge before doing it. if so, they will not be raised since their bodies are gone.

# a note on PLD cover strat for caloric 1

the strat in question is employed during the the tank busters that require a healer to use esuna:

- PLD uses cover on the other tank before the esuna hits go off. this makes it to where only the PLD is given the vuln stack, and only they need to be cleansed with esuna.
- the two tanks then move away from each other on the fourth hit to break cover’s tether

as a healer, i do not like this strat in an unorganized environment (PF). i would rather lose the 2 GCDs to esuna if it means both tanks do the consistent thing that every tank knows how to do. the cover strat adds an extra point of potential failure.

in my opinion, just because you can do something different doesn’t mean you should.
