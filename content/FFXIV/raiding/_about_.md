title: _about my raid notes_
---

as mentioned, i play FFXIV. it's one of my favorite games of all time. my character is silly millie ðŸŒ¸ faerie, and i have a decently extensive amount of experience when it comes to raiding. there can be a lot that goes into it, so i've been trying to come up with a way to archive the stuff i come acrossâ€”useful diagrams and some notes i've takenâ€”in preparation for dawntrail, the next expansion.

my notes aren't meant to be very in-detail about what each mechanic is like. they're more like things to keep in mind once you *do* know the mechanic; they're tiny intricacies that will help save the occasional pull or give you a more thorough understanding once you've learned the basics.

[here are my logs.](https://www.fflogs.com/character/na/faerie/silly%20millie) hopefully they give me a little bit of credibility in your eyes.
