# general notes
- you don't have to immediately be in front of or behind the boss for front/rear combination. if you're quick, you can be in the unsafe spot then move after the first in/out.
- after you take cover behind the safe meteor, you have a lot of time before it detonates. you can easily slidecast your way out of this as a healer. do not lose uptime here.
- make sure you use some healing/mitigation for the second knockback, the one before LC2. those raidwides do a lot of damage very quickly.
- if you're a healer, get ready to use LB3 after LC2

there needs to be healing and mitigation throughout this mechanic, since everyone gets blasted. it's most important that the person who gets the final defamation gets a little bit of help: a regen, a shield like adloquium or TBN, etc. they have to be further away from everyone because of the defamation, and they will miss AOE heals as a result.

the final defamation has to receive healing because of what happens right after LC1: the boss comes back, does dualspell, then immediately does a raidwide. since it's targetable right after LC1 ends, it's smart to get your GCDs done before LC1 ends and not after. gotta maintain that uptime!

# limit cut 2
i'm gonna be real: i have no idea how this mechanic is supposed to work. i understand how the numbers go away while the party takes a stack that scales with proximity damage. however, i feel like in PF, *some* of the party stack always dies. i don't know if it's because the proximity isn't big enough or if there's not enough mit. something always goes wrong. as a result, i've noticed that i have to save pulls in a specific way.

## healer LB3 strat ("plan A")
the only *guaranteed* way to keep a failed LC2 pull going with LB3 is to do it before the dualspell goes off and not after. if you wait until after dualspell, you run the risk of a healer dying to them getting double targeted by dualspell. i am not a fan of rolling those dice, so i found out a way to make sure it always works. the only downside is that the OT has to flex.

the proper way to do it is as follows:
- the healer baits a number (ideally 1 or 2) to ensure that they are not part of the stack
- if too many people die in the stack, wait until the fourth defamation goes off
- run towards the OT's spot—true south—for the upcoming lightning dualspell
- rip that LB3
- the OT flexes by taking the healer's spot: west if H1 used it, east if H2 used it

### why make OT flex?
the reason the OT has to flex is because of LB3's lengthy animation lock. the healer is completely rooted in place for 10 full seconds, which does not give them enough time to run to their regular spot. even if they died, the OT has a good chunk of time to look at whether east or west is open and to fill in that empty space.

the healer that used LB3 does not have time to run to their original spot, but they do have time to adjust for either in/out if they're already at the south spot.

### other possible solution
there may be a way to do this without making OT flex. if the healer instead baits for 3 or 4, they may be able to healer LB3 in their original clock spot, which means south is free for OT. i've never tried this as any other number except for 1 or 2, so i can't say for sure if this variant would work.

i think that the biggest obstacle would be whether or not the healer would have enough time to adjust for the in/out. this may still be more consistent if your OT is unreliable. if you can't adjust for in/out, it might be worth it for you to pre-position for one of those two possibilities and rip that LB3. you'd have a 50/50 shot of surviving, and if you die, it would be just you dead as opposed to the entire party wiping and having to start all over.

alternatively, you could just tell your party to push their buttons and skip LC2. the best way to solve a mechanic is to not have to do it in the first place.
