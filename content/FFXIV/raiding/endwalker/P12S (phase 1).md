# general notes
- [the pastebin that everyone in aether talks about](https://pastebin.com/gc93tBFY)
- tank invuln does not block damage down from getting hit by trinity of souls (triple half room cleave)
- you can move in place for trinity of souls much earlier than you might think
- para 3 needs some solid mitigation, as well as the on the soul raidwide immediately after (divine veil or shake it off are great for this!)
- tank invuln does not prevent being killed by theos’s ultima after limit cut
- don’t forget to look north during superchain 2B!

# superchain 1
people who have the spread debuff can die without consequence. the same cannot be said about people *without* the spread debuff—if any of those players die, it is likely a wipe.

if a non-spread does die, it is possible for a spread with the correct debuff to soak their tower and to keep the pull going. it requires incredibly fast awareness and adjusting, and will probably cause a wipe anyway if someone gets clipped by the spread you’re taking onto the tower. it’s worth a try if you’re progging para 3.

example of a spread dying and the pull continuing as normal:

# limit cut
**it is imperative that you stay as close to the wall as possible when baiting dashes.** the damage scales with proximity, and if you’re off by a few pixels, you will likely die unless you’re a tank.

if you’re a healer or tank, try to pay attention to players 6 and 8. they take the final jumps from the boss, and the mitigations/shields typically used at the start of the mechanic usually run out by the time they take the jumps. the same applies to 5 and 7, just not as badly from my experience.
