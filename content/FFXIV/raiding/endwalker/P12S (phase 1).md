# general notes
- [the pastebin that everyone in aether talks about](https://pastebin.com/gc93tBFY)
- tank invuln does not block damage down from getting hit by trinity of souls (triple half room cleave)
- you can move in place for trinity of souls much earlier than you might think
- para 3 needs some solid mitigation, as well as the on the soul raidwide immediately after (divine veil or shake it off are great for this!)
- tank invuln does not prevent being killed by theos’s ultima after limit cut
- don’t forget to look north during superchain 2B!

# superchain 1
people who have the spread debuff can die without consequence. the same cannot be said about people *without* the spread debuff—if any of those players die, it is likely a wipe.

if a non-spread does die, it is possible for a spread with the correct debuff to soak their tower and to keep the pull going. it requires incredibly fast awareness and adjusting, and will probably cause a wipe anyway if someone gets clipped by the spread you’re taking onto the tower. it’s worth a try if you’re progging para 3.

example of a spread dying and the pull continuing as normal:

# limit cut
**it is imperative that you stay as close to the wall as possible when baiting dashes.** the damage scales with proximity, and if you’re off by a few pixels, you will likely die unless you’re a tank.

if you’re a healer or tank, try to pay attention to players 6 and 8. they take the final jumps from the boss, and the mitigations/shields typically used at the start of the mechanic usually run out by the time they take the jumps. the same applies to 5 and 7, just not as badly from my experience.

# healer LB3 after superchain 2A (sac strat)
people tend to die a lot during SC2A. for a group that's progging and just trying to practice SC2B, it's worth it to learn how everyone can sac so that the healer can live and use LB3. this is not required since the healer can just time it so that the LB3 goes off right as they die to the party in/out mech after SC2A.

all you have to do is position yourself so that at least one person is in the center of the boss's hitbox and that at least one person is farther away from the boss than the healer. here's a diagram showing the spacing [as well as a video showing a real example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jii6OY28u0)

make sure you give yourself healing/mitigation/shields so that you survive the raidwide after. i personally don't use it until after the raidwide goes off to ensure that nobody dies to it due to a lack of mitigation.
